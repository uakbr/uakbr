## â˜‘ A brief overview of what I do: **Cloud Engineering**
* I engineer cloud-based systems that are based on these tenets: 
   * **Resiliency** - If something "goes wrong" in the code; the program is able to self-heal or continue without affecting the entire system itself.
   * **Highly-available** - The system is *ideally* available at all times; the system converges towards an error-free state and is therefore self stabilizing.
   * **Redundancy** - There will always be multiple identical instances of the system and it will switch to one of the redundant instances in case of failover.
   * **Efficiency** - The above three cost a lot to achieve; my designs are extremely efficient. If there is too much code, complexity, both, or either, I will revert the changes and re-create the system until it is. Being efficient and having all three of the above is a requirement. Until that is achieved my work is not complete.
